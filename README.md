# MatLab-Projects

**Homework 1:** Covers random matrix generation, element-wise operations, row and column statistics, and building structured arrays. Also includes practice with loops, countdown timers, and user input, focusing on MATLAB’s core programming and vectorization.

**Homework 2:** Introduces Psychtoolbox for visual display. The program opens a full-screen window, divides the screen into quadrants, and shows colored text. It also places the word “random” in different spots and shades to demonstrate randomization, text rendering, and display timing.

**Homework 3:** Builds a simple interactive survey using Psychtoolbox. The program shows instructions, gathers input on language background, voter registration, age, and favorite color, and checks for valid responses. Results are saved to a file, demonstrating screen control, keyboard input, and data storage.

**Homework 4:** Implements a reaction-time experiment in Psychtoolbox. A yellow circle changes color, shape, or position after a random delay, and participants press the spacebar as quickly as possible. The program measures response times, randomizes trials, and saves results.

**Homework 5:** Creates an interactive mood-rating tool with the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM). The program slices icons from an image, highlights them on hover, and lets users select one to match their mood. It handles real-time mouse tracking, screen drawing, and saves the data.

**Homework 6:** Runs an auditory reaction-time experiment. Participants hear a tone in the left ear, right ear, or both, and press the spacebar when it plays. The program records response times, manages subject IDs, and saves results using PsychPortAudio.

**Homework 7:** Examines how sound affects perception of an animation. Two circles meet behind a square while a bonk or whoosh plays, and participants judge whether they bounced or passed through. The program randomizes sound conditions, records responses, and saves results.
